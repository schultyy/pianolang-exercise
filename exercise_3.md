# Exercise 3

Create a new file `parser.rb`. In that file create a function `parse` which takes a list as argument:

```ruby
#parser.rb
def parse(tokens)
  #...
end
```

The purpose of that function is to consume the tokens and to calculate the result of the term provided. This means for the list of tokens `["plus", "2", "3]` it should return the value `5`.
